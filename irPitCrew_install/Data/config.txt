# Configuration File for irPitCrew.
# 
# This file is automatically created on startup if it does not exist.
# 
# New attributes will be added dynamically; for example, when a new car
# is first encountered, a new DisplayCarFuelAsWeight_ value will be 
# added to the file, which can then be configured manually.
# 


# Specify the fuel units to use on the remote display.
# 0 for Metric, 1 for Imperial.
# 
DisplayFuelImperial 0

# This applies to races based on number of laps (not relevant in timed races).
# If this is set to 0, will use the session (race leader) remaining laps
# to calculate fuel.
# Set to 1 to use the your (driver) remaining laps instead.
# Setting this to 1 gives you more fuel (unless you are the leader).
# 
UseDriverLapsRemaining 1

# Skip the "clear" command on Apply.
# If set to 1, irPitCrew will not unset the current iRacing black box settings for
# tires, fuel, fast repair, etc. before applying the new settings.
# This means values currently selected in iRacing will not be unset by irPitCrew.
# 
# This setting is useful if you are only using the App for fuel and don't 
# want it to clear your tires / fast repair settings on Apply.
# 
# Another option if using this setting is to set "autoResetPitBox = 0" in
# iRacing's app.ini file, which should give you one "clear" when you leave
# the pit stall, then Auto Apply will do one Apply when driving back in.
# 
SkipClearOnApply 0

# Port to use for server.
# Change this value if the current port is blocked for some reason and the remote display
# is unable to connect to the server. In general, select from the range 1024 - 49151.
# When connecting from the remote display, specify the port by adding it to the
# target address, for example:
# For address 192.168.1.45 and port 5000, specify 192.168.1.45:5000 in the browser address bar.
# 
ServerPort 48900

# Laps of Fuel to add to the calculated fuel value for an extra margin of safety.
# For example: Set to 2 for two extra laps of fuel, or 0.5 for an extra half lap.
# Default: 0
# 
ExtraLapsOfFuel 0

# DisplayCarFuelAsWeight: 0 for volume (litres), 1 for weight (kg).
# Manually adjust these per car based on how the car displays fuel.
